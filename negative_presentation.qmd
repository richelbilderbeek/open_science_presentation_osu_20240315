# The guidelines

## Problem

-   EU/UNESCO want Open Science
-   in Sweden, there is a gap between current practices and Open Science

## Guidelines

## The six proposed guidelines

1.  Open access to scientific publications
2.  Open access to research data
3.  Open research methods
4.  Open learning resources
5.  Public participation in the research process
6.  Infrastructures that support open science

# The criticism

-   Ironically in Swedish
-   Unconvincing to any critical reader
-   Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems in academia
-   Will create more resistance against Open Science

# Ironically in Swedish

-   **Ironically in Swedish**
-   Unconvincing to any critical reader
-   Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems in academia
-   Will create more resistance against Open Science

## Ironically in Swedish

From @unesco_os_toolkit:

> Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable.

It is ironic that the guidelines are in Swedish: so science **policy** does not need to be inclusive?

No English translation after exactly two months!

(Note that OSU is in English with the goal of being inclusive!)

# Unconvincing to any critical reader

## Unconvincing to any critical reader

Let's start with the second sentence in @guidelines:

> Syftet med arbetet för öppen vetenskap är att bidra dels till ökad vetenskaplig kvalitet, dels att förbättra samspelet mellan forskningen och det omgivande samhället.

In English:

> The purpose of the work for open science is to contribute partly to increased scientific quality, partly to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society.

## Unconvincing to any critical reader

> The purpose of the work for open science is to contribute partly to increased scientific quality, partly to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society.

No references!

-   'increased scientific quality': how much was the increase? how was scientific quality defined?

## Unconvincing to any critical reader

> The purpose of the work for open science is to contribute partly to increased scientific quality, partly to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society.

No references!

-   'to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society': how much does Open Science improve this action? How was the quality of the interaction defined? What about the industry?

## Unconvincing to any critical reader

> The purpose of the work for open science is to contribute partly to increased scientific quality, partly to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society.

Within OSU, we **look for** and **share** those references!

## Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems

If 'The purpose of [the guidelines] is to contribute partly to increased scientific quality' @guidelines, let's look at the most important problems in academia.

Here I show three studies.

## Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems

First study: @gopalakrishna2022prevalence used an anonymous survey to measure the prevalence of Questionable Research Practices.

-   6813 Dutch filled it in correctly
-   fraud rate: 2%

## Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems

| \%   | QRP                                                | Addressed |
|------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 17.5 | No submission of a valid negative finding          | No        |
| 17.0 | Not mentioning flaws in the study                  | Maybe     |
| 15.0 | Too little supervision                             | No        |
| 14.7 | Too little attention to proper use of technology   | No        |
| 14.5 | Too little documentation of the scientific process | Yes       |

## Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems

Second study: @munafo2017manifesto is a manifesto for reproducible science, which aligns closely with the KB proposal, as both papers intend to increase the reproducibility of science.

## Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems

Third study @fraser2018questionable, none are addressed:

## Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems

If 'The purpose of [the guidelines] is to contribute partly to increased scientific quality' @guidelines, the most prevalent problems in academia are addressed poorly.

# Will create more resistance against Open Science

-   Ironically in Swedish
-   Unconvincing to any critical reader
-   Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems in academia
-   **Will create more resistance against Open Science**

## Will create more resistance against Open Science 1/3

From the guidelines @guidelines:

-   \[open data\] researchers get support to make data FAIR from e.g. universities
-   \[open methods\] researchers get support to make research methods FAIR from research-performing organizations
-   \[public participation\] research-performing organizations offer support

It insinuates Open Science costs more time.

## Will create more resistance against Open Science 2/3

Why people do QRPs @gopalakrishna2022prevalence:

![](gopalakrishna_et_al_2021_questionable_table_3b_annotated.png)

## Will create more resistance against Open Science 3/3

Adding more work will discourage doing Open Science. Or would the support actually save time?

My statements:

-   if support **actually** saves time, most scientists will do Open Science
-   this is not the case
-   this is possible

# Conclusion

Criticism on @guidelines

-   Ironically in Swedish
-   Unconvincing to any critical reader
-   Nearly no effect on the most prevalent problems
-   Will create more resistance against Open Science

# Discussion

-   There are solutions for all these problems

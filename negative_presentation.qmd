## The six proposed guidelines

1.  Open access to scientific publications
2.  Open access to research data
3.  Open research methods
4.  Open learning resources
5.  Public participation in the research process
6.  Infrastructures that support open science

## Criticism

- Ironically in Swedish
- Unconvincing to any critical reader

## Ironically in Swedish

From @unesco_os_toolkit:

> Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable. 

It is ironic that the guidelines are in Swedish:
so science **policy** does not need to be inclusive?

No English translation after exactly two months!

(Note that OSU is in English with the goal of being inclusive!)

## Unconvincing to any critical reader 1/4

Let's start with the second sentence in @guidelines:

> Syftet med arbetet för öppen vetenskap är att bidra dels till ökad vetenskaplig kvalitet, dels att förbättra samspelet mellan forskningen och det omgivande samhället. 

In English:

> The purpose of the work for open science is to contribute partly to increased scientific quality, partly to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society. 

## Unconvincing to any critical reader 2/4

> The purpose of the work for open science is 
> to contribute partly to increased scientific quality, 
> partly to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society. 

No references!

- 'increased scientific quality': how much was the increase? how was scientific quality defined?

## Unconvincing to any critical reader 3/4

> The purpose of the work for open science is 
> to contribute partly to increased scientific quality, 
> partly to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society. 

No references!

- 'to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society':
  how much does Open Science improve this action? How was the quality of the interaction defined?
  What about the industry?

## Unconvincing to any critical reader 4/4

> The purpose of the work for open science is 
> to contribute partly to increased scientific quality, 
> partly to improve the interaction between research and the surrounding society. 

Within OSU, we **look for** and **share** those references!

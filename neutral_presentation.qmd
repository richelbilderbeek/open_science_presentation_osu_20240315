## The six proposed guidelines

1.  Open access to scientific publications
2.  Open access to research data
3.  Open research methods
4.  Open learning resources
5.  Public participation in the research process
6.  Infrastructures that support open science

## Guidelines overview

# Open access to scientific publications

-   publications must be open access under an open license
-   publication costs not paid by either readers or authors, should be transparent and decrease
-   authors hold copyright

# Open access to research data

-   research data "as open as possible, as limited as necessary" and FAIR
-   it should be possible to work with open data
-   cost-effective management of open data
-   researchers get support to make data FAIR from e.g. universities

# Open methods

-   research methods, protocols and program code "as open as possible, as limited as necessary", documented sufficiently and FAIR
-   researchers get support to make research methods FAIR from research-performing organizations
-   research methods should use open licenses, be shared and shared in a standarized way
-   different research fields develop their own standards for sharing research methods

# Open learning resources

-   use of open learning resources is encouraged and coordinated
-   open learning resources have an open licenses and are FAIR
-   maybe a joint platform for open learning resources is needed?

# Public participation in the research process

-   when relevant, the public should become more involved
-   research-performing organizations offer support
-   funding reward citizen science more

# Infrastructures that support open science

-   open science infrastructures is financed nationally
-   more money to non-profit infrastructures for open access publishing
-   develop infrastructures of open research methods
-   develop standards that link together publications, research data and methods

# Conclusion

Sweden likes Open Science

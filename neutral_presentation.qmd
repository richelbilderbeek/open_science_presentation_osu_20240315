## Problem

-   EU/UNESCO want Open Science
-   in Sweden, there is a gap between current practices and Open Science

## The six proposed guidelines

1.  Open access to scientific publications
2.  Open access to research data
3.  Open research methods
4.  Open learning resources
5.  Public participation in the research process
6.  Infrastructures that support open science

## Guidelines overview

![](guidelines_overview.png)

# Open access to scientific publications

-   publications must be open access under an open license
-   publication costs not paid by either readers or authors, should be transparent and decrease
-   authors hold copyright

# Open access to research data

-   research data "as open as possible, as limited as necessary" and FAIR
-   it should be possible to work with open data
-   cost-effective management of open data
-   researchers get support to make data FAIR from e.g. universities

# Open methods

-   research methods, protocols and program code "as open as possible, as limited as necessary", documented sufficiently and FAIR
-   researchers get support to make research methods FAIR from research-performing organizations
-   research methods should use open licenses, be shared and shared in a standarized way
-   different research fields develop their own standards for sharing research methods

# Open learning resources

-   use of open learning resources is encouraged and coordinated
-   open learning resources have an open licenses and are FAIR
-   maybe a joint platform for open learning resources is needed?

# Public participation in the research process

-   when relevant, the public should become more involved
-   research-performing organizations offer support
-   funding reward citizen science more

# Infrastructures that support open science

-   open science infrastructures is financed nationally
-   more money to non-profit infrastructures for open access publishing
-   develop infrastructures of open research methods
-   develop standards that link together publications, research data and methods

# Conclusion

Sweden likes Open Science

# Appendix

## Open access to scientific publications

-   That all types of scientific publications that are wholly or partially produced with public funds must be published with immediate open access.
-   That publication takes place with an open license, in accordance with the FAIR principles and with support in guiding information from the Royal Library.
-   That costs associated with open access publication are not covered by either readers or individual authors

## Open access to scientific publications

-   That costs associated with publication should be transparent and reduce over time without impacting Swedish researchers' opportunities to disseminate research results in the form of scientific publications.
-   That measures are taken that promote authors retaining the economic copyright to his works.

# Open access to research data

## Open access to research data

-   That research data produced within the framework of publicly funded research by 2026 at the latest is made available according to the principle "as open as possible, as limited as necessary".
-   That the making of research data, including metadata, takes place in accordance with the FAIR principles and with the support of guidance information from the Swedish Research Council and the Agency for Digital Management (Digg).

## Open access to research data

-   That strategic orientations, supporting and technical measures that create conditions for open access to research data exist at all appropriate levels and in working methods, processes and routines.
-   That cost-effective management of open access to research data is ensured. In the first place, costs associated with making data openly available according to the FAIR principles should be clearly identified.

## Open access to research data

-   That research-performing organizations, including research infrastructures, give researchers access to adequate support, knowledge-raising initiatives and reliable, appropriate and interoperable technical solutions that enable openly available research data according to the FAIR principles.

# Open research methods

## Open research methods

-   That methods, protocols and program code are made available as openly as possible and as limited as necessary to guarantee transparency regarding the data collection and analysis process.
-   That research methods are always documented and made available at a sufficiently detailed level.
-   That research methods are made available in such a way and with sufficient metadata that the FAIR criteria are met.

## Open research methods

-   That research-performing organizations, including research infrastructures, give researchers access to adequate support, knowledge-raising initiatives and reliable, appropriate and interoperable technical solutions that enable openly accessible research methods.
-   That standards for sharing research methods are used and developed within and based on experiences from different research areas and with regard to international development.
-   That reuse of research methods is facilitated by open licenses is used and indicated where applicable.

# Open learning resources

## Open learning resources

-   That universities and colleges have policies and guidance for the production and use of open learning resources.
-   Open learning resources and their metadata are shared with open licenses and to the extent possible in accordance with the FAIR principles, with the aim of promoting dissemination and reuse.

## Open learning resources

-   That the work with open learning resources at universities and colleges is coordinated.
-   That the need for and conditions for a joint platform to gather and disseminate open learning resources are investigated.

# Public participation in the research process

## Public participation in the research process

-   That principles and methods for how the public can be involved in the research process are developed, known and established within all research disciplines where it is relevant to the quality and development of the research.
-   That research-performing organizations offer developed methodological support and knowledge-raising efforts for researchers about how the public can be involved in the research process.

## Public participation in the research process

-   That research funding organizations develop policies and assessment criteria around collaboration, co-creation and public participation in the research process.

# Infrastructures that support open science

## Infrastructures that support open science

-   That international services and infrastructures that support open science are financed nationally in a coordinated manner.
-   That non-profit infrastructures for open access publishing should be particularly supported.

## Infrastructures that support open science

-   That infrastructures that enable adequate and future-proof sharing of open research methods are developed.
-   That standards and technical solutions that link together publications, research data and methods are used and developed.
